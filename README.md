Hey everyone!
This is a simple ATM project I built using Core Java. I wanted to understand how real banking systems work internally, especially things like account creation, PIN verification, money transfer, and maintaining transaction history.So I created this mini ATM simulation using only Java and text files.

It's a console-based project, easy to run, and beginner-friendly.
